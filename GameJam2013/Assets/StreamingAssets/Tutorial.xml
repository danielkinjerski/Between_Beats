  <TutorialText>Welcome to life Between Beats.</TutorialText>
  <TutorialText>There is a lifetime between the sound waves of a rhythm.</TutorialText>
  <TutorialText>It is normal, everyday life for beings like Fre-qun to live and die between them.</TutorialText>
  <TutorialText>Fre-qun lives just a tad slower than the speed of sound, so he sees the waves very differently.</TutorialText>
  <TutorialText>The only way for him to survive is to find the seed of the next beat.</TutorialText>
  <TutorialText>He must live between beats.</TutorialText>
  <TutorialText>Move with arrows or wasd. There is also controller support.</TutorialText>
  <TutorialText>Jump with 'a' or space.</TutorialText>
  <TutorialText>Rush with right bumper or shift.</TutorialText>
